* What is this
My personal Emacs configuration (WIP) which I use for editing Rust code with LSP (rust-analyzer) mainly and occasionaly for Python, different markup languages.

Originally I used Prelude, but it become too overburdened so I decided to redo everything from beginning. However a lot of stuff I copied from Prelude, especially keybindings.

* Installation

Should work out-of-box on Emacs 29.4 and higher on Linux.

First launch will take time to install all packages (I :ensure all mentioned packages on purpose). Installation will download few additional resources: tree-sitter .so files from GitHub (using tree-sitter-langs package) and nerd-fonts (will ask interactively if needed to be download). After installing all packages will be byte-compiled in background, potentially producing warnings in separate window (can be ignored).
